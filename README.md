# Flow Chart for Resident User
The flowchart diagram below shows the overview functionalities of the system in terms of resident user. After creating an account and receiving approval from the barangay administrator, the resident can then log in. The user can now request papers, read announcements, view officials, view barangay information, send an inquiry and report a blotter after logging in.
